# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- i18n: i18next + react-i18next for translations, AsyncStorage for language persistence
- Translation files live in src/i18n/locales/{en,es,fr}.ts; config in src/i18n/index.ts
- LanguageProvider wraps entire app in root layout; useLanguage() hook for context
- First-launch detection: check AsyncStorage for stored language; null = first launch
- Pattern: useTranslation() + t('key.path') in every screen for translated strings
- Language change: update i18n + AsyncStorage + UserProfile.referenceLanguage in DB
- Expo SDK 54 uses expo-router v6 with file-based routing
- Entry point for expo-router is "expo-router/entry" in package.json main field
- @expo/vector-icons must be installed separately with --legacy-peer-deps due to react-dom peer dep conflict
- Tab navigation in expo-router uses directory-based tabs: app/(tabs)/tabname/_layout.tsx + index.tsx
- npx expo install handles version compatibility; npm install --legacy-peer-deps for manual installs
- Old App.tsx and index.ts files should be removed when migrating to expo-router
- Test compilation with `npx expo export --platform android` instead of web (web needs react-dom)
- Theme/design system lives in src/theme/, shared components in src/components/
- Import theme: `import { colors, typography, spacing, borderRadius } from '../src/theme'`
- Import components: `import { Button, Card, ProgressBar, Badge } from '../src/components'`
- Link component with asChild for navigation buttons: `<Link href="..." asChild><Button .../></Link>`
- Database layer lives in src/database/; import via `import { ... } from '../src/database'`
- expo-sqlite v16 uses synchronous API: openDatabaseSync, runSync, getFirstSync, getAllSync, execSync
- DB schema uses snake_case columns; TypeScript models use camelCase; row-to-model mappers convert between them
- Singleton DB pattern: getDatabase() lazily initializes and returns cached instance
- CRUD pattern: typed Row interface → rowToModel mapper → parameterized queries with ? placeholders
- Content schema: Course > Unit > Lesson > Exercise hierarchy in src/content/
- Seed data versioned via AsyncStorage; bump CURRENT_SEED_VERSION to re-seed
- Exercise types: multiple_choice, translation, fill_blank, match_pairs, listening
- LocalizedString { en, es, fr } used for all user-facing content text
- getCourseContent() for full course; getLessonById() for specific lessons
- Vocabulary inserted into DB on first load; exercises read from bundled TS
- Alphabet data: src/content/alphabetData.ts; GREEK_ALPHABET array + generateQuizOptions()
- FlatList with numColumns for grid layouts; use columnWrapperStyle for row spacing
- StyleSheet.create infers literal types; use `ViewStyle` annotation for mutable style variables
- Modal with presentationStyle="pageSheet" for slide-up detail cards
- In-screen tab switcher pattern: useState<TabMode> + Pressable styled tabs
- Exercise engine: useState currentIndex + exerciseKey; key prop forces child re-mount to reset state
- ListeningExercise shares shape with MultipleChoiceExercise; reuse MC component for both
- XP formula: base 10 + Math.round(accuracy * 5) for up to 15 XP per lesson
- Exercise components: MultipleChoiceExercise, TranslationExercise, FillBlankExercise, LessonSummary in src/components/
- Fuzzy matching: normalize(NFD) + strip diacritics + lowercase for accent/case-insensitive comparison
- FillBlankExercise supports word bank (tap chips) or text input fallback
- ViewStyle/TextStyle annotations needed when mutable variables switch between StyleSheet styles
- Streak logic: src/database/streakLogic.ts; getOrCreateStreak(), recordLessonForStreak(), checkStreakOnAppOpen()
- DailyStreak is singleton; ISO date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) for day comparison
- Freeze banking: 1 freeze per 7-day milestone; freeze covers exactly 1 missed day (gap === 2)
- useFocusEffect on Home screen checks/resets broken streaks on app open

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project Scaffolding & Navigation Shell
- What was implemented:
  - Expo project with TypeScript, expo-router v6 file-based routing
  - Bottom tab navigation with 4 tabs: Home, Lessons, Review, Profile
  - Stack navigator (_layout.tsx) nested in each tab directory
  - Placeholder screen for each tab with title and subtitle
- Files changed:

  - app/(tabs)/review/_layout.tsx + index.tsx
  - app/(tabs)/profile/_layout.tsx + index.tsx
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - create-expo-app won't run in a dir with existing files; use temp dir + copy approach
  - node_modules copy/move is unreliable; better to just `npm install` fresh
  - TypeScript check: `npx tsc --noEmit`; compilation test: `npx expo export --platform android`
  - Ionicons import: `import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons'`
---

  - app/(tabs)/review/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (themed)
  - app/(tabs)/profile/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (themed + showcase link)
  - app/(tabs)/profile/component-showcase.tsx (new showcase screen)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - src/theme/ and src/components/ are the canonical locations for design system code
  - All screens should import colors/typography/spacing from theme instead of hardcoded values
  - Stack screenOptions pattern for consistent headers: headerStyle, headerTitleStyle, headerShadowVisible, headerTintColor
  - Must read a file before writing to it (Claude tool requirement)
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Local Database & Data Models
- What was implemented:
  - expo-sqlite v16.0.10 installed via `npx expo install expo-sqlite`
  - Database initialization with WAL mode and schema auto-creation (src/database/db.ts)
  - TypeScript data models for all 5 entities: UserProfile, LessonProgress, VocabularyItem, ReviewCard, DailyStreak (src/database/types.ts)
  - Insert and Update helper types (Omit-based) for each model
  - Full CRUD helpers for each model with parameterized queries
  - Row-to-model mappers converting snake_case DB columns to camelCase TypeScript
  - Barrel export (src/database/index.ts) for clean imports
  - SQLite indexes on frequently queried columns (lesson_id, category, next_review_date, vocabulary_id)
  - Foreign key constraint: review_card.vocabulary_id → vocabulary_item.id with ON DELETE CASCADE
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added expo-sqlite dependency)
  - src/database/types.ts (data model types + insert/update types)
  - src/database/db.ts (database init, schema creation, getDatabase singleton)
  - src/database/userProfile.ts (CRUD for UserProfile)
  - src/database/lessonProgress.ts (CRUD for LessonProgress)
  - src/database/vocabularyItem.ts (CRUD for VocabularyItem)
  - src/database/reviewCard.ts (CRUD for ReviewCard)
  - src/database/dailyStreak.ts (CRUD for DailyStreak)
  - src/database/index.ts (barrel export)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - expo-sqlite v16 sync API: openDatabaseSync, runSync, getFirstSync, getAllSync, execSync, withTransactionSync
  - SQLite stores booleans as INTEGER (0/1); mappers convert to/from TypeScript boolean
  - Update helpers use dynamic field building pattern to only SET provided fields
  - UserProfile and DailyStreak are singletons (one row); use getUserProfile()/getDailyStreak() without ID
  - Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection; execSync does NOT support params (only for DDL/PRAGMA)
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Reference Language Selection (EN / ES / FR)
- What was implemented:
  - i18next + react-i18next for internationalization with 3 reference languages (EN, ES, FR)
  - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for persisting language selection
  - Translation files for all UI strings in English, Spanish, French
  - LanguageProvider context wrapping the entire app (manages init, first-launch, language changes)
  - Language picker screen shown on first launch (fullscreen with flag icons)
  - All UI strings across all screens now load from translation files via useTranslation()
  - Change Language screen accessible from Profile tab
  - Language selection persisted to both AsyncStorage and UserProfile.referenceLanguage in SQLite
  - Root layout handles loading state and first-launch redirect
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added i18next, react-i18next, @react-native-async-storage/async-storage)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (English translations)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (Spanish translations)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (French translations)
  - src/i18n/index.ts (i18n config, init, changeLanguage, AsyncStorage persistence)
  - src/i18n/LanguageProvider.tsx (React context for language state, first-launch detection)
  - app/_layout.tsx (LanguageProvider wrapper, loading state, first-launch redirect)
  - app/language-picker.tsx (first-launch language selection screen)
  - app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx (translated tab labels)
  - app/(tabs)/home/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (translated strings)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (translated strings)
  - app/(tabs)/review/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (translated strings)
  - app/(tabs)/profile/_layout.tsx + index.tsx (translated strings, change language button)
  - app/(tabs)/profile/change-language.tsx (language change screen in Profile stack)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - i18next init is async; LanguageProvider shows loading spinner until ready
  - useTranslation() returns { t, i18n }; t('key.path') for translation, i18n.language for current lang
  - Language stored in two places: AsyncStorage (for app-level i18n) and UserProfile DB (for data logic)
  - First-launch flow uses router.replace('/language-picker') from root layout useEffect
  - --legacy-peer-deps needed for AsyncStorage install (react-dom peer dep conflict)
  - expo-router Stack.Screen registered in _layout.tsx even for dynamically navigated routes
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Lesson Content Data Structure & Seed Data
- What was implemented:
  - Content schema types: Course > Unit > Lesson > Exercise hierarchy (src/content/types.ts)
  - 5 exercise types: multiple_choice, translation, fill_blank, match_pairs, listening
  - LocalizedString type for EN/ES/FR translations on all content
  - Seed data for Unit 1 "Alphabet & Basics" with 5 lessons (src/content/seedData.ts):
    1. First Greek Letters (Α-Ε)
    2. More Greek Letters (Ζ-Κ)
    3. Basic Greetings
    4. Introducing Yourself
    5. Numbers 1-5
  - Each lesson has vocabulary items and 4-5 exercises of varied types
  - Seed data loader (src/content/seedLoader.ts) with version checking via AsyncStorage
  - Vocabulary auto-inserted into SQLite database on first launch
  - Content accessors: getCourseContent(), getUnitById(), getLessonById(), getAllLessonsFlat()
  - Barrel export (src/content/index.ts)
  - Integrated initializeSeedData() into LanguageProvider startup
- Files changed:
  - src/content/types.ts (new - content schema types)

  - src/content/seedLoader.ts (new - data loader + content accessors)
  - src/content/index.ts (new - barrel export)
  - src/i18n/LanguageProvider.tsx (added initializeSeedData call on startup)
  - PRD.md (marked US-005 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Content lives in src/content/; types, seed data, and loader are separate files
  - Seed data is versioned via AsyncStorage key; bump CURRENT_SEED_VERSION to re-seed
  - Exercise content uses LocalizedString for all user-facing text (prompt, options, translations)
  - Vocabulary is inserted into DB on first load; exercises are read directly from bundled TS
  - getCourseContent() returns the full course; getLessonById() for specific lessons
  - withTransactionSync wraps batch inserts for performance
  - Seed loader checks for existing records before inserting to avoid duplicates
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Greek Alphabet Learning Module
- What was implemented:
  - Complete Greek alphabet data file with all 24 letters (uppercase, lowercase, name, pronunciation, transliteration, example word with EN/ES/FR translations)
  - Alphabet screen accessible from Lessons tab with link card
  - Letter grid view (4 columns) showing all 24 letters with learned state indicators
  - Letter detail modal with big letter display, pronunciation guide, transliteration, example word, and audio placeholder button
  - Quiz mode: random letter presented, user picks correct pronunciation from 4 options, feedback shown, progress tracked
  - Progress bar showing letters learned / total
  - Tab switcher (Learn/Quiz) within alphabet screen
  - Mark as learned toggle per letter
  - i18n support for all UI strings in EN, ES, FR
  - Quiz completion summary with score
- Files changed:
  - src/content/alphabetData.ts (new - 24 Greek letters data + quiz option generator)
  - src/content/index.ts (added alphabet data exports)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/alphabet.tsx (new - full alphabet screen with grid, detail modal, quiz)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/_layout.tsx (registered alphabet screen in Stack)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/index.tsx (added alphabet section link card)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (alphabet translation keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (alphabet translation keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (alphabet translation keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-006 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - StyleSheet.create infers literal types; use `ViewStyle` annotation for variables that switch between styles
  - FlatList with numColumns + columnWrapperStyle for grid layouts
  - Modal with presentationStyle="pageSheet" for slide-up detail cards
  - generateQuizOptions() filters out letters with same pronunciation to avoid ambiguous distractors
  - Letter progress is currently in-memory (useState Set); will need DB persistence for cross-session tracking
  - Pattern: tab switcher within a screen using state + Pressable styled tabs
  - Alphabet data lives in src/content/alphabetData.ts separate from lesson seed data
---

## Iteration 7 - US-007: Lesson List & Unit Map Screen
- What was implemented:
  - Lessons tab now shows a vertical scrollable list of units with lesson nodes
  - Each unit card shows: localized title, unit number badge, completion count, progress bar with percentage
  - Lesson nodes display three visual states: completed (green checkmark), unlocked (blue with order number), locked (grey with lock icon)
  - Sequential unlock logic: first lesson always unlocked, others unlock when previous is completed
  - Tapping an unlocked lesson navigates to lesson detail screen (placeholder for US-008)
  - Locked lessons are not tappable (no Link wrapper)
  - Progress reloads from SQLite each time screen is focused via useFocusEffect
  - Alphabet section link preserved at top of screen
  - i18n support for unit map strings in EN, ES, FR
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/index.tsx (rewritten - unit map with lesson nodes)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (new - placeholder lesson screen)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/_layout.tsx (registered lesson screen in Stack)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (added unitMap translation keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (added unitMap translation keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (added unitMap translation keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-007 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - useFocusEffect from expo-router reloads data when screen gains focus (good for progress tracking)
  - getLessonStatus helper: uses global flat lesson array to determine sequential unlock order across units
  - Link with `as any` type assertion needed for dynamic query param routes in expo-router
  - Unit completion calculated as completed lessons / total lessons ratio
  - getAllLessonProgress() returns all DB records; build a Map<lessonId, LessonProgress> for O(1) lookups
  - Placeholder lesson screen created for navigation target; will be replaced by exercise engine in US-008
---

## Iteration 8 - US-008: Lesson Exercise Engine — Multiple Choice
- What was implemented:
  - Full lesson exercise engine replacing placeholder lesson screen
  - Exercises displayed sequentially with progress bar at top and question counter
  - MultipleChoiceExercise component: prompt, 4 options, select-then-check flow
  - Correct answer highlights green with checkmark, wrong answer highlights red with X
  - User must select an answer and press "Check" before proceeding (cannot skip)
  - Feedback banner shows "Correct!" / "Incorrect" with correct answer shown on miss
  - After last exercise, lesson summary screen with trophy icon, XP earned (base 10 + up to 5 accuracy bonus), accuracy %, and correct/total count
  - Retry button available if accuracy < 100%
  - Listening exercises rendered as multiple choice (same structure)
  - Unsupported exercise types (translation, fill_blank, match_pairs) show skip placeholder
  - exerciseKey state forces re-mount of exercise components between questions
  - i18n strings added for exercise engine and lesson summary in EN, ES, FR
  - LessonSummary component uses Card and Button from design system
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (rewritten - full exercise engine)
  - src/components/MultipleChoiceExercise.tsx (new - MC exercise component)
  - src/components/LessonSummary.tsx (new - lesson completion summary)
  - src/components/index.ts (added new component exports)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (exercise + lessonSummary keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (exercise + lessonSummary keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (exercise + lessonSummary keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-008 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Exercise engine pattern: useState for currentIndex + exerciseKey; key forces re-mount to reset child state
  - useCallback with setTimeout(300ms) provides brief delay for feedback visibility before advancing
  - ListeningExercise has same shape as MultipleChoiceExercise (prompt, options, correctIndex) so can reuse MC component
  - XP formula: base 10 + Math.round(accuracy * 5) for up to 15 XP per lesson
  - SkipExercise component handles unsupported exercise types without blocking lesson flow
  - handleAnswer tracks newCorrect locally since setState is async (can't rely on correctCount in same callback)
---

## Iteration 9 - US-009: Lesson Exercise Engine — Translation & Fill-in-the-Blank
- What was implemented:
  - TranslationExercise component: shows prompt + Greek text, user types answer in TextInput
  - Fuzzy matching: normalize() strips accents (NFD + diacritic removal), lowercases, trims, collapses spaces
  - checkAnswer compares normalized user input against all acceptedAnswers from exercise data
  - FillBlankExercise component: shows sentence with blank + word bank (Pressable chips) or text input fallback
  - Word bank mode: tap to select/deselect word, selected word highlighted in primary color
  - Text input fallback: same fuzzy matching as translation when no wordBank provided
  - Both exercise types integrated into lesson engine renderExercise() switch statement
  - Consistent feedback UI: green/red borders, checkmark/X icons, correct answer shown on miss
  - Check → Continue button flow matches existing MultipleChoiceExercise pattern
  - i18n strings added: typeAnswer, chooseWord in EN, ES, FR
- Files changed:
  - src/components/TranslationExercise.tsx (new)
  - src/components/FillBlankExercise.tsx (new)
  - src/components/index.ts (added exports)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (integrated translation + fill_blank cases in renderExercise)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (typeAnswer, chooseWord keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (typeAnswer, chooseWord keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (typeAnswer, chooseWord keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-009 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - StyleSheet.create literal type issue: use ViewStyle/TextStyle annotations for mutable style variables
  - Fuzzy matching pattern: normalize(NFD) + strip \u0300-\u036f range removes all combining diacritics
  - Fill-blank supports dual input modes: wordBank (tap chips) or free-text (TextInput)
  - Exercise components follow same structure: prompt, input area, feedback banner, check/continue button
  - Seed data already has translation and fill_blank exercises in Lesson 3-5; no new seed data needed
---

## Iteration 10 - US-010: Lesson Exercise Engine — Match Pairs
- What was implemented:
  - MatchPairsExercise component: two columns (Greek left, translations right) with shuffled order
  - Tap-to-select from each column; matching pair index = correct match
  - Correct pairs highlight green with checkmark and lock (opacity 0.7, disabled)
  - Incorrect pairs flash red with shake animation (Animated.Value translateX) and reset after 600ms
  - Exercise auto-completes when all pairs matched; shows success feedback
  - "Perfect match" message when no mistakes; "All matched" when mistakes > 0
  - onAnswer(true) only when zero mistakes; otherwise onAnswer(false)
  - Fisher-Yates shuffle for both columns (useMemo for stability)
  - Integrated into lesson engine renderExercise() switch with match_pairs case
  - i18n strings: matchPairs, greek, translation, perfectMatch, allMatched in EN/ES/FR
- Files changed:
  - src/components/MatchPairsExercise.tsx (new - match pairs exercise component)
  - src/components/index.ts (added MatchPairsExercise export)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (added match_pairs case + import)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (match pairs i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (match pairs i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (match pairs i18n keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-010 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Match pairs uses pair index as the key for matching: greek[i] matches translation[i]
  - Shuffled display order via useMemo + Fisher-Yates; original pair indices used for match logic
  - Animated.Value with translateX for shake effect on incorrect matches
  - setTimeout(600ms) for incorrect flash duration before resetting selection
  - Seed data already has match_pairs exercises in all 5 lessons of Unit 1; no new seed data needed
  - Match pairs differs from other exercises: no check/continue button flow; auto-advances on completion
---

## Iteration 11 - US-011: XP System & Lesson Completion
- What was implemented:
  - XP calculation: base 10 XP + accuracy bonus (up to 5 XP for 100%) = max 15 XP per lesson
  - LessonProgress record created/updated on lesson completion with score, XP, timeSpent, completedAt, attempts
  - UserProfile.totalXp updated with XP earned; currentLevel derived from totalXp (every 100 XP = 1 level)
  - Smart XP handling: re-completing a lesson only adds XP diff if new score is higher (prevents XP farming)
  - Time tracking: useRef(Date.now()) at lesson start, delta calculated on completion
  - Lesson summary now shows 3 stats: XP earned, accuracy %, time spent (formatted as Xm Ys)
  - Timer resets on retry
  - i18n: timeSpent key added to EN/ES/FR translation files
  - Completing a lesson creates LessonProgress record which unlocks the next lesson (existing unlock logic in lessons/index.tsx checks progressMap)
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (DB imports, startTimeRef, saveLessonCompletion, savedXp/savedTimeSpent state)
  - src/components/LessonSummary.tsx (added timeSpentSeconds prop, formatTime helper, time stat column, heading2 for stat values)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (lessonSummary.timeSpent)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (lessonSummary.timeSpent)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (lessonSummary.timeSpent)
  - PRD.md (marked US-011 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - saveLessonCompletion pattern: check existing → create or update → update profile XP
  - XP diff pattern prevents inflation: xpToAdd = max(0, newXP - existingXP)
  - Level formula: Math.floor(totalXp / 100) + 1 (level 1 at 0 XP, level 2 at 100 XP, etc.)
  - useRef for timers avoids re-render; Date.now() for start, delta on completion
  - LessonProgress.completed = true is what getLessonStatus() checks to unlock next lesson
  - With 3 stat columns, heading2 (fontSize 22) fits better than heading1 (fontSize 28)
---

## Iteration 12 - US-012: Daily Streak System
- What was implemented:
  - Streak business logic module (src/database/streakLogic.ts) with:
    - getOrCreateStreak(): initializes singleton streak record if needed
    - recordLessonForStreak(): called on lesson completion, increments/resets streak
    - checkStreakOnAppOpen(): resets broken streaks when user opens app
  - Streak logic: consecutive days increment, missed day resets to 0
  - Streak freeze: 1 freeze banked per 7-day streak milestone (7, 14, 21, etc.)
  - Freeze protects exactly 1 missed day (gap of 2 days between last activity and today)
  - Home tab displays streak card with flame icon, current streak, longest streak, and freeze count
  - Streak card uses Ionicons flame (active=secondary gold, inactive=disabled gray) and snow (freezes)
  - Streak recorded automatically on lesson completion via recordLessonForStreak() in saveLessonCompletion
  - checkStreakOnAppOpen() called via useFocusEffect on Home screen to detect broken streaks
  - i18n strings for streak UI in EN, ES, FR
- Files changed:
  - src/database/streakLogic.ts (new - streak business logic)
  - src/database/index.ts (added streak logic exports)
  - app/(tabs)/lessons/lesson.tsx (added recordLessonForStreak call in saveLessonCompletion)
  - app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx (rewritten - streak card with flame icon, stats, freeze info)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (streak i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (streak i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (streak i18n keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-012 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Streak logic lives in src/database/streakLogic.ts separate from CRUD helpers
  - DailyStreak is singleton pattern: getOrCreateStreak() ensures exactly one record
  - ISO date string comparison (YYYY-MM-DD) works for day-level equality checks
  - daysBetween() helper calculates gap for freeze eligibility (gap === 2 means 1 missed day)
  - Freeze banking: Math.floor(newStreak/7) > Math.floor(oldStreak/7) detects crossing 7-day multiples
  - useFocusEffect on Home tab is the right place to check/update streak state on app open
  - Flame icon from Ionicons ("flame") + snow icon ("snow") for freezes
---

## Iteration 13 - US-013: Home Dashboard
- What was implemented:
  - Full home dashboard with stats row (Level, Total XP, Reviews Due) in 3 elevated cards
  - Streak card preserved from US-012 with flame icon, longest streak, and freeze count
  - Daily goal card with progress bar and dynamic text (goal met vs. progress)
  - "Continue Learning" button navigates to next uncompleted lesson (primary colored card)
  - Fallback states: "All lessons complete!" (trophy) when done, "Start your first lesson!" when no progress
  - Level derived from total XP: Math.floor(totalXp / 100) + 1
  - Daily goal defaults to 1 lesson/day (from UserProfile.dailyGoal field, configurable in Profile later)
  - Review due count from getDueReviewCards() (spaced repetition cards)
  - Today's completed lesson count from new getTodayCompletedLessonCount() DB helper
  - All data refreshes on screen focus via useFocusEffect
  - i18n support for all new strings in EN, ES, FR
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx (rewritten - full dashboard with stats, streak, goal, continue)
  - src/database/lessonProgress.ts (added getTodayCompletedLessonCount helper)
  - src/database/index.ts (exported new helper)
  - src/i18n/locales/en.ts (home dashboard i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/es.ts (home dashboard i18n keys)
  - src/i18n/locales/fr.ts (home dashboard i18n keys)
  - PRD.md (marked US-013 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - getTodayCompletedLessonCount: SQL COUNT with completed_at >= start-of-day timestamp
  - getNextLesson: iterate allLessonsFlat(), find first where progressMap has no completed entry
  - Stats row pattern: 3 flex:1 Cards in a row with gap for even spacing
  - Card backgroundColor override works because style prop is applied last in the Card component
  - ScrollView with contentContainerStyle for scrollable dashboard; paddingBottom for safe area
  - Daily goal stored in UserProfile.dailyGoal (default 1); Profile settings screen will make it configurable
